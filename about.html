            <h1>The Chronicles of Marnia</h1>
            <h2>It's the chronic...</h2>
            <p>I graduated magna cum laude from Denison University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. Shortly after graduating, I was recruited as GM and lead photographer for a Colorado-based outdoor adventure photography company, and that is when I made Breckenridge my new home.
                Prior to making the transition to software engineering, my passion for connecting had led me to hospitality, and I spent the past 8 years of my career with Vail Resorts, planning meetings and events. 
                In addition to juggling moving deadlines and changing plans, this career path taught me the challenges and the beauty of working with people. I truly love collaborating and making authentic connections to create memorable moments and events.
                Throughout my life, I’ve prided myself on being an advocate for sustainability. One of my favorite pastimes is enjoying the extensive trail system in my home town of Breckenridge. I’ve been a loyal volunteer with the Friends of Breckenridge Trails Program since moving to town in 2007. I've really enjoyed this opportunity to have a positive impact on my community.
